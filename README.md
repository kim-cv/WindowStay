# WindowStay
This software is not completed nor ready for use, still work in progress.

# Which problem does it solve?
I have two computer screens and whenever I start my computer I have a few startup programs aswell, the problem is they will not remember their position or size, it annoys me I have to do that manually everytime and therefore decided to make some software which can do it for me.

# How does it work
Remember, its still not ready for use, but here is how it will work.
* You position and scale your windows
* Open WindowStay
* Click GetWindow and Save for all the window positions you want to save
* Click Settings and check "Automatically position saved windows on StartUp?"
* Enjoy your iced coffee :)
